# Testing Repository

This repository contains 78 test cases for our medical product testing.
The structure is organized by Suites (regulatory alignment) and Automation Levels (execution strategy).

Tagging System

Each test uses pytest markers for suite and automation level:

import pytest

@pytest.mark.suite("smoke")
@pytest.mark.level("auto")
def test_tls_port_open():
    # TODO: implement TLS port check
    assert True

Suites: smoke, system, pipeline, clinical

Levels: auto, semi, manual

Manual tests are skipped automatically but remain in reports for traceability:

@pytest.mark.suite("clinical")
@pytest.mark.level("manual")
@pytest.mark.skip(reason="Manual validation required: UAT with clinicians")
def test_user_acceptance():
    pass

CI/CD Integration

Tests are executed in three GitHub Actions jobs:

ðŸŸ¢ Automation Block â†’ runs all auto tests (~65% of cases)

ðŸŸ¡ Semi-Automation Block â†’ runs semi tests, flagged for review (~25%)

ðŸ”´ Manual Block â†’ manual tests are reported as pending (~10%)

Workflow: .github/workflows/tests.yml

Benefits

Maximum automation: majority of tests run fully in CI/CD

Traceability: all Suites & test IDs visible for audits (IEC 62304, IEC 81001-5-1)

Clarity: manual and semi-automated tests are flagged, not hidden

How to Use

Generate test files (already prepared with placeholders):

python generate_tests.py

Run automated tests locally:

pytest -m "level('auto')"

Run semi-automated tests:

pytest -m "level('semi')"

Manual tests remain pending and must be performed according to the QA/Clinical checklist.

Key principle:
Changes trigger Suites â†’ Suites trigger Auto/Semi/Manual tests â†’ CI/CD runs what is automatable.
